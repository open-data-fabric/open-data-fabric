# Open Data Fabric

Version: 0.41.0

# Abstract
**Open Data Fabric** is an open protocol specification for decentralized exchange and transformation of semi-structured data that aims to holistically address many shortcomings of the modern data management systems and workflows.

# Problem Statement
Develop a method of semi-structured data exchange that would:
- Enable worldwide collaboration around data cleaning, enrichment, and transformation.
- Create an environment of verifiable trust between participants without the need for a central authority.
- Enable a high degree of data reuse, making quality data more readily available.
- Reduce the time it takes data to propagate from publishers to consumers.
- Introduce a feedback loop between the consumers and publishers of data that would facilitate improvements around data availability, recency, and design.
- Provide foundation for implementing data anonymization techniques to simplify and speed up the exchange of vital but sensitive data.

# Requirements
Functional:
- **Complete historical account** - when data is used to gain insight and to drive decision-making discarding or modifying data is akin to rewriting history. The history of all data observed by the system must be preserved.
- **Reproducibility** - the ability to reproduce the results is a cornerstone of the scientific method without which the process and findings of one party cannot be verified by others. Therefore, we require that all the transformations performed within the system must be fully reproducible, and it must be possible to get a reference to data that is frozen in time and never changes to achieve reproducibility of any process that uses it.
- **Verifiability** - any party that plans to use some data must be able to verify its validity.
- **Provenance** - regardless of how many transformation stages the data went through, it should be possible to trace any individual data cell back to its ultimate source and understand which data contributed to its existence and its value.

Non-Functional:
- **Transparency** - the method itself should be developed in the open, easy to understand, and reason about.
- **Timeliness** - the method should aim to minimize the propagation time of data through the transformation pipeline. The frequency with which data is presented to consumers should be optimized for their experience and usability, not dictated by limitations of the data pipeline.
- **Transactionality** - once data is in the system all operations should have [ACID properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) and exactly-once semantics.
- **Decentralization** - there must be no entity in the system with any kind of special privileges over data, or abilities to circumvent any of the above requirements.

# Scope
The primary focus of this specification is the **mission-critical data** such as:
- Business performance data (sales, CRM)
- Governmental data
- Financial data
- Healthcare data
- Scientific data
- As well as any other data used for decision-making

This specification does not target very high volume sources like IoT and sensor data where infinite retention of the entire history may be cost-prohibitive. We do, however, hope to shift the mindset of the data science community towards thinking about such cases as **design compromises**. Routine data loss should no longer be our default mode of operations.

# Design Decisions

## Nature of Data
In modern data science "data" is a very broad term that includes many shapes and forms of quantitative and qualitative records. We will not attempt to provide a taxonomy here but will claim that the large portion of data published today carries in it the limitations and design compromises of systems that generated it.

> Examples:
>
> **Snapshot data** - many [OLTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing) systems are designed to only maintain the current state of the information. The data sourced from OLTP systems is usually in the form of periodic database dumps (snapshots) or [change data capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) logs at best.
>
> Such data has many limitations:
> - It's often accompanied by data loss (e.g. all data changes between the two snapshots are lost).
> - Data is anemic and doesn't carry the business context of the changes.
>
> **Aggregated data** is the form of data in which information from several measurements is combined and expressed in a collective or summary form. This form of data is very common in governmental and healthcare sources, where aggregations often hide important deprivations and inequalities between gender, ethnic, and other groups.
>
> Although such styles of data have become the norm for many major data publishers today, we believe that such treatment is **inadequate** and at odds with many of the requirements we put towards the system. Data is our modern-day history book and should be treated as such.

To achieve the desired qualities we choose the following narrow definition of data:

> Data is a set of events, observations, or propositions believed to be true at a certain time.

Properties:
- Data is a set of event records / relational tuples
- Events are **immutable**
- Event set can only grow
- Every event set can be viewed as a potentially infinite event stream

Such representation poses many additional challenges when working with data, but, as we will show further - the benefits by far outweigh the added complexity, and that complexity can in most cases be addressed by better tooling.

## Nature of Transformations
The state-of-the-art approach to transforming data today is to version the source data (using a hash sum or a stable reference) and version the code that transforms it (using a version control system). The result of transformations is then uploaded to some shared storage and made available to others. There are many tools that improve the reproducibility of such workflows, but all of them treat data as a mere binary blob, deprived of its intrinsic qualities.

This leads to many problems:
- Data is routinely copied
- Modified versions of data essentially create new datasets that cannot be easily traced to their origin
- The history of transformations (provenance) cannot be easily established
- It is practically impossible to verify that no accidental or malicious alterations were made

As a result, our workflows create large quantities of datasets that are disjoint from their sources, that contribute to the overall "noise" when searching for data but cannot be meaningfully reused. Any data scientist that cares about the validity of their results therefore mush begin with a clean slate and work with the primary authoritative source of data.

> Modern data science is stuck in a loop where all forward progress is constantly lost because no mechanism exists for making incremental improvements to data.

### Components of Trust
We believe that the most important factor in enabling reuse and collaboration on data is **trust**.

While the implicit trust may be enough within an enterprise, trust on the global scale cannot be blind - it is only possible through transparency, reproducibility, and verifiability of the results. Those qualities cannot be easily layered on top of the existing tools, so we designed the system from the ground up with those qualities at its core.

In our design we achieve trust with following solution criteria:
- When using any data you must be able to trace its source to a trusted authority that originally published it
- All transformations that were applied to it must be known and can be audited
- The results of those transformations can always be reproduced by following the same transformation steps

![Diagram: Transformation](images/transform.svg)

Components:
- Transformations are expressed using [Queries](specs/glossary.md#query) written in any of the supported languages.
- Queries combine and transform one or many input data streams into an output stream.
- Queries are executed by the [Engines](specs/glossary.md#engine) - a software that knows how to interpret and execute a certain query dialect.
- The results of queries must be deterministic - always produce the same results for the same set of inputs.
- Engines run in a "sandbox" environment, where they don't have access to a network or any other external resources.
- Engines are strictly versioned as their implementation contributes to the total determinism of the operation.

A transformation executed with the same query, on the same inputs, and using the same version of an engine is **guaranteed to be reproducible**.

This is indeed a very hard departure from the ways of working with data that we are used to. It prohibits using anything external to the system - there can be no API calls, no manual editing of data, no use of 3rd party libraries that are not part of the engine.

The benefits we get in exchange for this strictness are, however, immense:
- **Complete transparency** on where data comes from.
- Ability to audit all transformations.
- Ability to easily **reproduce** and **verify** all results.

All this combined allows us to build **verifiable trust** between parties.

### Derivative Data Transience
Since past data in the input datasets is immutable and all transformations are required to be deterministic - derivative datasets are **functionally dependent** on their inputs. This means that for any given transformation graph it is possible to fully reconstruct data of all derivative datasets from the data of root datasets by simply re-applying all transformations.

> Data in derivative datasets can be considered a **form of caching** and does not require durable storage.

### Stream Processing Model
As we model all data as potentially infinite event streams (see [Nature of Data](#nature-of-data)), it's quite natural to use the **stream processing** techniques for all data transformations.

When working with temporal events, stream processing has the following benefits:
- Lets users define a query once and potentially run it forever. This nicely addresses the **timeliness** requirement, allowing us to minimize the latency with which data propagates through the system.
- Streaming queries are expressive and are closer to _"which question is being asked"_ as opposed to _"how to compute the result"_. They are usually much more concise than equivalent batch queries.
- They can be expressed in a way that is agnostic of how and how often the new data arrives. Whether the data is ingested once a month in Gigabyte batches, in micro-batches every hour, or as a true near real-time stream - processing logic can stay the same, produce the same results, and guarantee the best propagation times possible.
- Modern stream processing techniques make complex problems like handling late and out-of-order data much simpler, more explicit, and significantly less error-prone than equivalent batch operations.

### Essential Role of Metadata
Metadata is the cornerstone of our design. It contains every aspect of where the data came from, how it was transformed, and everything that ever influenced how data looks like throughout its entire lifetime. In a way it's like a digital passport of data using which we can audit and verify its validity (see [Transfer Protocols: Design Goals](specs/exchange/transfer-protocols.md#design-goals)).

The metadata is always updated whenever data gets updated and stays fully consistent with it. The two are cryptographically linked, making spoofing it near impossible.

Metadata also has an immutable append-only nature. While the rest of the document describes it as a standalone technology, its format is designed to make it easy to integrate with existing ledger-based systems such as blockchain.

## Evolution of Data
As the nature of businesses change, as new requirements arrive, as defects are detected and fixed - it's not a matter of *if* but *when* the time comes to make changes to the data. Calling data a potentially infinite stream would not make much sense without providing a way to improve and evolve it over time. Having to create a new dataset every time you need to change the schema or update the transformation would jeopardize the timeliness requirement, as the entire chain of transformations would have to be rebuilt from scratch after every such change.

Our design goals are, therefore:
- To seamlessly support all backward-compatible data schema changes
- To support the evolution of transformations over time
- To provide a way to correct past mistakes in data

While for simplicity we previously considered derivative datasets to be only defined by one transformation query, in fact it can comprise multiple queries that were active during different periods of time. The metadata keeps track of which parts of inputs were processed by which query and which parts of output were produced as the result, ensuring reproducibility. This idea will be further explored when we discuss the [Metadata Chain](specs/glossary.md#metadata-chain), but for now, get used to the idea that **almost anything that defines a dataset can change over time**.

## Transactional Semantics
To achieve a perfect reproducibility the system needs to satisfy very strong transactional properties:
- All coordination operations including things like ingesting, downloading, and sharing data, creating and updating datasets must have [ACID properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID).
- All data transformations must have **exactly-once** semantics.

# Specification

## Dataset Identity
The identity of a dataset consists of:
- [Unique identifiers](#unique-identitifiers) - used to unambiguously identify datasets on the network, e.g. when referencing one dataset as an input of another.
- [Aliases and references](#aliases-and-references) - used for human-friendly naming.

### Unique Identifiers
ODF is designed to be compatible with [content-addressable storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage). When stored in such storage, all parts of a [Dataset](specs/glossary.md#dataset) can be accessed by having only a hash of the last [MetadataBlock](specs/glossary.md#metadata-chain).

As [Dataset](specs/glossary.md#dataset) grows, however, a reference to a single [MetadataBlock](specs/glossary.md#metadata-chain) will only provide access to a subset of its history. To refer to a [Dataset](specs/glossary.md#dataset) as a whole a different identifier is needed that can be resolved into a hash of the latest block. Such identifiers must be globally unique, issuable with no central authority, and tied to a proof of ownership over a dataset.

ODF follows the [W3C DID Identity Scheme](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) using a custom `did:odf` method. This method is based closely on [`did:key` method](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/) that derives the unique identity from a public key of a cryptographic key pair.

Example:

<pre>
did:odf:fed012126262ba49e1ba8392c26f7a39e1ba8d756c7469786d3365200c68402ff65dc
</pre>

The identifier is formed by:
- Generating a cryptographic key pair (e.g. using `ed25519` algorithm)
- Taking the public key part
- Prepending an appropriate [multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec) value to identify the algorithm (e.g. `ed25519-pub`)
- Encoding data with [multibase](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase) encoding using `base16` scheme

Or in pseudocode:

<pre>
did-odf-format := 'did:odf:' + MULTIBASE(
  base16,
  MULTICODEC(
    public_key_type,
    public_key_bytes,
  )
)
</pre>

The resulting DID is stored in the first [MetadataBlock](specs/glossary.md#metadata-chain) in the chain of every [Dataset](specs/glossary.md#dataset), called [Seed](#seed-schema).

Tying the identity of a dataset to a cryptographic key pair provides a way to create unique identity in a fully decentralized way. The corresponding private key can be used to prove ownership and control over a [Dataset](specs/glossary.md#dataset) and to delegate access.

> Note that the only difference between `did:odf` and `did:key` method is the encoding scheme. ODF uses `base16` instead of `base58btc` for reasons explained in the [Hash Representation](specs/datasets/metadata-chain.md#hash-representation) section. Because conversion between the two encodings is trivial, ODF is compatible with authorization frameworks that work with `did:key` method. We expect that in future the `did:key` spec will be extended to allow `base16` encoding too, further minimizing the difference.

See also:
- [RFC-003: Content Addressability](/rfcs/003-content-addressability.md)
- [RFC-012: Recommend base16 encoding](/rfcs/012-recommend-base16-encoding.md)

### Aliases and References
Formats described below provide human-friendly ways to refer to a certain dataset. Note that they are only meaningful within the boundaries of a [Repository](specs/glossary.md#repository). Unlike [Dataset IDs](#unique-identitifiers) they are not collision-free and mutable.

Depending on the context we differentiate the following types of references:
- **Local Format** - used to refer to a dataset within a local workspace (can be single- and multi-tenant)
- **Remote Format** - used to refer to a dataset located in a known [Repository](specs/glossary.md#repository) provider.

As you will see in the examples below, we recommend (but not require) using the [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation) for [Dataset](specs/glossary.md#dataset) names.

Examples:
<pre>
// Dataset ID
did:odf:fed012126262ba49e1ba8392c26f7a39e1ba8d756c7469786d3365200c68402ff65dc

// Local Format - DatasetName is highlighted
<b>property.parcel-polygons</b>
<b>cities</b>
<b>admin0.countries.10m</b>

// Local Multi-tenant Format - AccountName is highlighted
<b>statcan.gc.ca</b>/census.2016.population
<b>ny-newyork</b>/public-safety.ems-incident-dispatch

// Remote Format - RepoName is highlighted
<b>statcan.gc.ca</b>/census.2016.population
<b>us.cityofnewyork</b>/public-safety.ems-incident-dispatch
<b>data.gov</b>/ny-newyork/public-safety.ems-incident-dispatch

ipfs://bafkreie3hfshd4ikinnbio3kewo2hvj6doh5jp3p23iwk2evgo2un5g7km/
</pre>

Note that name components such as `DatasetName`, `AccountName`, `RepoName` are case-insensitive, i.e. names `ny-newyork` and `NY-NewYork` are considered identical during lookups and uniqueness checks within the repository.

Full [PEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) grammar:
```
DatasetRefAny = 
  DatasetRefRemote /
  DatasetRef

DatasetRef = 
  DatasetId /
  DatasetAlias

DatasetRefRemote =
  (RepoName "/")? DatasetId /
  DatasetAliasRemote /
  Url

DatasetAlias = 
  (AccountName "/")? DatasetName

DatasetAliasRemote = 
  RepoName "/" (AccountName "/")? DatasetName

DatasetId = "did:odf:" Multibase
DatasetName = Hostname
AccountName = Hostname
RepoName = Hostname

Hostname = Subdomain ("." Subdomain)*
Subdomain = [a-zA-Z0-9]+ ("-" [a-zA-Z0-9]+)*

Multibase = [a-zA-Z0-9+/=]+
Url = Scheme "://" [^\n]+
Scheme = [a-zA-Z0-9]+ ("+" [a-zA-Z0-9]+)*
```

## Coordinator Contract
The main functions of the [Coordinator](specs/glossary.md#coordinator) are:
- Maintain the [invariants](#requirements) and the [semantics](#transactional-semantics) of the system
- Guarantee the validity and integrity of the [Metadata](specs/glossary.md#metadata-chain)
- Provide means for ingesting external data into the system
- Interface with the [Engines](specs/glossary.md#engine) to implement data transformations
- Enable data sharing functionality via [Repositories](specs/glossary.md#repository)
- Provide additional functionality to simplify working with [Datasets](specs/glossary.md#dataset) and their metadata

### Derivative Transformations
[Previously](specs/transformations/engine-contract.md#execute-query) we looked at how an [Engine](specs/glossary.md#engine) executes the transformation query. Here we will look at what happens on the [Coordinator](specs/glossary.md#coordinator) side.

![Sequence Diagram: Execute Query](images/engine_transform.svg)

Here are the steps that the [Coordinator](specs/glossary.md#coordinator) performs during the transformation:
- **Batch step** - Analyze the [Metadata Chains](specs/glossary.md#metadata-chain) of the [Dataset](specs/glossary.md#dataset) being transformed and all the inputs. The goal here is to decide how far the processing can progress before hitting one of the special conditions, such as a change of schema in one of the inputs or a change of the transformation query.
- **Run migrations** (when needed) - If a special condition is encountered - call the [Engine's](specs/glossary.md#engine) [Migrate Query](specs/transformations/engine-contract.md#migrate-query) operation to make necessary adjustments for the new transformation parameters.
- **Run query** - Pass the input [Data Slices](specs/glossary.md#data-slice) into the [Engine's](specs/glossary.md#engine) [Execute Query](specs/transformations/engine-contract.md#execute-query) operation
- **Hash resulting data and checkpoint** - Obtain a stable [Hash](specs/glossary.md#hash) of the output [Data Slice](specs/glossary.md#data-slice) and [Checkpoint](specs/glossary.md#checkpoint) (see [Data Hashing](specs/datasets/data-and-checkpoint-hashing.md#physical-and-logical-hashes) and [Checkpoint Hashing](specs/datasets/data-and-checkpoint-hashing.md#checkpoint-hashing))
- **Prepare commit** - Creates the next [Metadata Block](specs/glossary.md#metadata-chain) describing the output data
- **Commit** - Atomically adds the new [Data Slice](specs/glossary.md#data-slice) and the [Metadata Block](specs/glossary.md#metadata-chain) to the [Dataset](specs/glossary.md#dataset)

### Dataset Evolution
Most parts of the [Dataset](specs/glossary.md#dataset) can [change over time](#evolution-of-data). To protect downstream consumers of data from braking changes the [Coordinator](specs/glossary.md#coordinator) has to validate the changes for backward compatibility before accepting them. This section covers the allowed transitions for different parts of the [Metadata](specs/glossary.md#metadata-chain).

#### Query Evolution
The procedure for modifying the [Query](specs/glossary.md#query) of a [Derivative Dataset](specs/glossary.md#derivative-dataset) is as following:
1. The [Coordinator](specs/glossary.md#coordinator) invokes the [Engine's](specs/glossary.md#engine) [Validate Query](specs/transformations/engine-contract.md#validate-query) operation to validate the new [Query](specs/glossary.md#query) and determine the validity of the transition according to the engine-specific rules.
2. The new [Schema](specs/glossary.md#schema) returned in the previous step is validated according to the [Schema Evolution](specs/datasets/data-model.md#schema-evolution) rules.
3. A new [Metadata Block](specs/glossary.md#metadata-chain) is created and committed.

> **TODO**: Specify how Schema changes in the upstream datasets should be handled
> - Do we stop processing and ask user to validate that the query takes into account the new columns?

### Dataset Validation
The [Derivative Dataset](specs/glossary.md#derivative-dataset) validation confirms that the event data is in fact produced by applying all the transformations stored in the [Metadata](specs/glossary.md#metadata-chain) to the inputs and was not maliciously altered.

The process of validation is almost identical to the [Derivative Transformation](#derivative-transformations) except instead of the `Commit` phase the [Coordinator](specs/glossary.md#coordinator) compares the hashes of the data produced by local transform to the hashes stored in the [Metadata](specs/glossary.md#metadata-chain).

Due to non-determinism of Parquet format the physical hash may not match the one in metadata so a fallback to logical hash is required to verify that the resulting records are logically the same.
