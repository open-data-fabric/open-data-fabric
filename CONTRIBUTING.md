# Contribution Guidelines
We're keeping things simple. We have established a light-weight RFC process to introduce and keep history and context of changes. 

If you'd like to provide feedback or suggest an improvement - please open an issue on this repo or discuss proposal on Discord first before creating an RFC submitting a non-trivial PR.
