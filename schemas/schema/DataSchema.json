Arrow currently specifies only the [flatbuffer format](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/f9301c0ba8a7ed1b0b63275cfdd4c44c26b04675/format/Schema.fbs) which has many legacy to it and is not suited to be defined by humans, so we had to define our own schema format. While inspired by Arrow - this format makes a clear separation between logical data types and encoding (physical layout) of data in the chunks.",
